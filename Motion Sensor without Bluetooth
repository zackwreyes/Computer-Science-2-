/*
 * This is a setup for an adruino that reads a pir sensor
 * if a pir sensor picks up on movement it follows the code to
 * the bluetooth module where it reads 1 as to do something
 * or 0 to do nothing you can set the trap if you input a signal 
 * from the phone it will turn on for (5 seconds), or if you don't
 * want to set the trap it will reset after a period of time (30 seconds)
 * and go back to looking for movement through the pir sensor 
 * 
 * 
 * Will be trying to install a new library that goes into low mode that lowers the 
 * mma/phour and shutdowns other components on the board until called upon by code
 * this should be able to save up to 7x the power consumption before draining the power source
